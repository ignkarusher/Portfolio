# Portfolio
Here is my portfolio showing all of my accomplishments in terms of modeling, scripting and animating!

# Programming/Scripting:
Here are some things I have programmed in many languages:

https://github.com/ignkarusher/mc_fire_wand (Minecraft Fire Wand)

https://github.com/ignkarusher/mc_molten_boss (Minecraft Molten Golem Boss)

https://github.com/ignkarusher/ai_like_me (LLM that can write like you)

And Aura Simulator, a up-and-coming game with all the simulator components including animations, currency, tasks, GUI, areas and much, much more.
